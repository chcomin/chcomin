## 🙂 About Me  

Hello! I’m Prof. Cesar Comin, a university professor and Computer Vision researcher with a deep passion for enabling machines to perceive, understand, and interact with the world as humans do. 

📍 **Current Position**: Associate Professor at the Federal University of São Carlos 

🔬 **Research Areas**:  
- Biomedical image segmentation 
- Blood vessel segmentation, representation, and morphometry
- Interpretability of deep neural networks

\
🎓 **Teaching Focus**:  

I teach mostly introductory programming courses (in Python and C) and Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision courses, emphasizing hands-on learning with lots of coding practices.

## 🔬 Research Contributions  

I’ve published more than 60 works in top-tier journals regarding biomedical image analysis and complex systems (the subject of my PhD). Visit my [Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Iut1PNgAAAAJ) for a detailed list of publications. You can also view some research interests on my [lab's page](https://www.inag.ufscar.br/).

If you want to analyze vascular tissue samples, I've made [Pyvane](https://github.com/chcomin/pyvane), a framework to segment, represent and quantify tree-like structures.

## 🎓 Teaching Resources  

I have created many resources for students to learn Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision as well as basic programming practices (the resources are in Portuguese):

- [**Computer Vision**](https://github.com/chcomin/curso-visao-computacional-2024): 51 Jupyter notebooks and lecture notes about neural network fundamentals, image classification and segmentation, multimodal models, artificial image generation, and much more. 
- [**Digital Image Processing**](https://github.com/chcomin/curso-PDI): Jupyter notebooks regarding image filtering, multiscale processing, morphological operations, and many more topics.  
- [**Youtube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@cesarhcomin4117): Lectures regarding [Computer Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZnbzmzsJyI&list=PLV6nBLHbx0ri7Gh_szfwu3HGWCmIui4UM), [Digital Image Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JW1OsvsQV0&list=PLV6nBLHbx0riEUDgJrAogzpAt3qQquKVR), and [Introduction to Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9UGAkORZxk&list=PLV6nBLHbx0rgGYvvnQNFq6rw4zeoy6yJ6).
